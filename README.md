# Movies-ETL

### Overview
In this challenge, we had to undergo the ETL process (Extract, Transform & Load). We had to clean the data by re ordering columns, renaming columns, deleting duplicate values, utilizing lambda functions and ultimately merging our dataframes after the files were cleaned. I was able to shave off a lot of useless columns and keep the data that was most relevant and that could be used for actual analysis. THe data would now be able to be utilized by someone who wants to look at the ratings of movies by title, director, etc.
